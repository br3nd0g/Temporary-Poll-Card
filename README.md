# Temporary-Poll-Card
A card for a website, that is for a temporary poll.

## What It Entails

It's just some simple html and css, that you can insert in to a project.

You will most likely need to use a framework with it to store the results, but I will leave that to you.

I orginally made/used it for a temporary poll on my portfolio website, on whether I should change how it looks or not. I used the Python *Flask* framework, which allowed me file system usage to save the results to... a .txt file.
